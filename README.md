## Games Of Hearts AI Final Project 

## Description
In this project we implemented a card game called the game of hearts, it is typically a 4 player "trick avoidance" game.The player with the lowest points at the end of the game wins. The cards are ranked from Ace(high) to 2(low). The goal is to avoid taking cards worth points and to finish the game with the lowest score.
    - Hearts cards are worth 1pts
    - Queen Of Spades is worth 13pts
- In our version, the game is a two player game, were we have AI vs AI and each AI plays the game based one of the three evaluation metrics that we chose to implement. The performance of the metrics chosen are evaluated over 100 played games.
Our evaluation metrics include:
        - Point Based
        - Risk Based (shooting the moon)
        - Random Based 

## How to change types of AI players
